# Art Salad

Not about salads.

## Art Jigsaw puzzles in VR. On the web. Free and open-source.

Art Salad is a website that you can visit in immersive VR (with a virtual reality headset such as Meta Quest).     
Play around in VR with jigsaw puzzles made from 3D scans of art and history objects.   
It's fun, educative, and free.

Most models come from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), and all of them are under Creative Common license.
