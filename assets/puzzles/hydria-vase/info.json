	"description": "A hydria-type apothecary maiolica vase created in Savona (Italy) in the late 17th century. Handles in the shape of (fantastic) animal heads on massive bent necks. At the front, towards the bottom of the vase, a gargoyle in relief. Plugged with regular cork, its mouth doubles as an opening for pouring out the contents of the vase. Smaller gargoyles, without any openings, located under the handles, alongside the vase. At the front, above an inscription, a hand-painted decoration: a human figure keeping a two-headed dragon on a leash. A centaur slaying a dragon adorns the back of the vase. Colours: shades of blue. Inscription on the banderole: 'Aquæ. Plantag:s' (Aquæ Plantaginis). Aqua Plantaginis is a water distillate of broadleaf plantain (Plantago major L.) 'Plantago water is good for wounds, and because it is pungent, it is also good for any diarrhoea, especially if one suffers from intestinal pain. It should be consumed often, and it is also recommended as enema, which opens any clogged liver or spleen, cools down inflamed blood, and allows the healthy body to grow over fistulas, as it is conducive to tissue regeneration, especially of old wounds. It stops haemorrhoidal bleeding, as long as one thoroughly washes their rectum, that is, the final part of the large intestine, with it. It also soothes toothache, provided one washes their oral cavity with it'."
