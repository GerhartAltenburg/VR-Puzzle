	"description": "This tank sculpture in Prague's Kinský Square has had an eventful history. In July 1945 a monument was erected by Soviet army and municipal representatives on this square, it was a massive IS-2m heavy tank on a five-metre stone pedestal commemorating the end of German occupation in Prague. After the communist coup of 1948, the symbolic of the monument was changed to become a commemoration of the liberation of Prague by the Red Army, and the square was renamed Soviet Tank Square. During the deterioration of the URSS around 1990 the validity of this statue was becoming controversial, and art student David Černý painted the tank pink and erected a hand giving the finger on the turret, signing the work \"David Černý and the Neostunners\". After pressure from the Soviet government, Černý was arrested and the tank re-painted green. However members of the national parliament re-painted it pink in protest of Černý arrest, it was then re-painted green then pink a few more times, until Černý was released and the tank moved to the Military Museum Lešany. Later Černý became one of Czech Republic most preeminent artist, and in 2008 installed another pink tank sculpture at Kinský Square, called Tank Torso. It was quickly removed after opposition from then-Prime Minister Miloš Zeman, but re-appeared at the location in 2018 painted in green, where it has stood since. 4 years later in 2022 during Russian invasion of Ukraine, Černý re-painted the statue again, giving it the colors of Ukrainian flag as gesture of support."
