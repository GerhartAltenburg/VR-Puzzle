	"description": "Rijksmuseum Amsterdam - Already in the 18th century this famous sculpture was known by various nicknames, the best known of which was L’Amour Menaçant, ‘menacing love’. The threat is most evident in the Cupid’s knowing gaze, while the gesture he makes invokes us to secrecy. The statue was made for Madame de Pompadour, King Louis XV’s art-loving mistress.
