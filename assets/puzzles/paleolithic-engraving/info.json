	"description": "In 2019 a rock sanctuary was discovered, with Paleolithic engravings in the Cova de la Font Major. The engravings are in a non-visitable area and are made up of dozens of geometric and animal representations like this horse. The engravings are made on layers of very soft sandy silt and can be damaged at the slightest contact, for this reason and the difficulties of access to this area, they are not visitable. They are made up of sets of dozens of figurative (animal) and geometric (signs) representations, distributed in various panels within the galleries known as the Can Palletes crawlers."
