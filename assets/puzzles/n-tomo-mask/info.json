	"description": "This is a decorative mask shaped like the ritual n’tomo mask from the 2nd half of the 20th century. N’tomo masks are made among the Bambara peoples, by an association called Ntomo, to be precise, which belongs to the Mande-Tan group, living in the southern part of Mali near Bamako and along the Niger. It has always been presented in a semi-human and semi-animal form, crowned with 2 to 8 horns, called ma kolo (bones). It embodies a kind demon-ghost and is worn during dances and rituals to protect the Bamabra tribespeople who have not come of age yet. Often the top of the mask (the forehead) was adorned with an antelope figure. The object is a modern image of a mask which is both a decorative object and a souvenir.
