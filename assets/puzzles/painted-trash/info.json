	"description": "Lisbon. Art intervention with the help and support of GAU - Galeria de Arte Urbana. Art collaboration with Fooks Definbaher, widely known in narrow art circles. Varina is a fisherwoman, a traditional character namely from the fishing town of NazareÃÅ, on the central coast of Portugal. Her life is inseparably connected with the sea. She wears seven skirts, which symbolize, in different opinions, seven virtues, seven days in a week, the seven colors of the rainbow or any other mystical connection with the number seven. I prefer the legend about the seven waves: it is said that varinas use skirts to help count the waves of the sea while waiting on the coast, as they know that the seventh wave is calmer and can bring their man back home. Instead of skirts my varina wears streets of the fictional city. From some point of view, it could represent an idea of waiting but in a new background of modern life."
