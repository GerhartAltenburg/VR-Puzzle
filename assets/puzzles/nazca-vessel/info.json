	"description": "Modelled ceramic vessel with a bridge handle from the Nazca Valley in Peru. It dates from 200 to 800 BC and is kept at the Ethnological Museum of the Cultures of the World in Barcelona. This is an extremely fine, handmade globular ceramic vessel. On top, a conical spout and a representation of a human head are joined by a bridge handle. The vessel is brightly painted to show a maritime divinity swimming and dragging a net full of fish. The figureâ€™s head is also sculpted. The Nazca Valley receives very little rainfall and the streams that cross it are dry most of the year. This forced the inhabitants to come up with complex system of aqueducts (puquios) to take advantage of subterranean water. Local ceramics show a great deal of concern for survival, with an iconography often depicting maritime and agricultural products."
